#### Constraining the modified friction in gravitational wave propagation with precessing black hole binaries

A broad class of modified gravity theories predicts a friction-like effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs), altering their amplitude damping and thus modifying the standard GW luminosity distance. Measuring both luminosity distance and source redshift therefore provides a way to constrain such effects.  

In this work, we explore the prospects of testing this modified friction using precessing binary black holes observed by ground-based GW detectors. We simulate 20 precessing events detected by a network consisting of two LIGO detectors and two third-generation facilities (the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer), with redshift information obtained from host galaxy identification in the GLADE+ catalog. We show that binary precession substantially improves the precision of luminosity distance measurements, enabling significantly tighter bounds on the modified friction parameters.  

Assuming narrow cosmological priors consistent with Planck 2018, we find that third-generation detectors can constrain the friction effect with a precision far exceeding current GWTC-3 results. Our study highlights the potential of precessing binary black holes as powerful probes of modified gravity and sets the stage for future research with next-generation GW observatories.
